## PUNJAB - Paani Utna Nikalo Jitna Ai Bole

**Actual Problem :** To be considered with Pani Bachao Paise Kamao scheme of Government of Punjab

## USP
Using low-cost opensource hardware and our in-house machine learning datamodels, we helped in solving one of the biggest problems of the Government of Punjab. Our project not only solves the issue of wastage of electricity but also the wastage of groundwater. And helps farmers 

## Further Research
Scope of this project is far bigger than what could be done in the Thapar Institute of Technology's Saturnalia Hackathon. This is a big project and requires time and research beyond the scope of this hackathon.
Currently no one is doing any work in this area. So further field tests and research is required to refine our datasets.
